With more than 15 years experience in the medical billing industry, we are able to deliver exceptional solutions for our clients.
Medical billing is the process of submitting and following up on claims with health insurance companies in order to receive payment for services rendered by a healthcare provider.
Mono development team embraced the "smart client" paradigm to develop scalable and distributed, HIPAA-compliant set of applications that combine the best features of both web and desktop approaches. Over the years, it has evolved to support modern Web back- and front-end tools, as well as mobile clients and cloud-based infrastructure. The finished system handles millions of patient records for dozens of clients, with hundreds of users on two continents - yet it provides the full comfort of a rich user interface that has been missing from the alternative implementations.
Every part of a rather complex business workflow was covered with a separate, independent module  from the initial receiving of the hospital paperwork and patient data entry, through the coding, insurance, and patient billing, to the follow-up and collection/write-off of the remaining debt.
Such modules support advanced claim processing and verification logic, eligibility checks, electronic superbills, payment reminders, and customized reports.
Aside from the conventional GUI, designed to mimic the billing processing workflow, the system implements numerous specialized modules that required careful investigation and implementation:
* Scanned document processing
* Electronic data interchange
* Business Intelligence
Tools and technologies: .NET Win Forms, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Communication Foundation, SQLServer, SQLServer Reporting Services, SQLServer Analysis Services, Power BI

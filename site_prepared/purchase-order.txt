Our solution automates purchase order processing, making life simpler for our clients that work with different suppliers and have branch offices in different locations.
Our clients work with different supplies and materials and have branch offices in different locations. They have a number of vendors from which they can purchase the supplies, but the market is very competitive - each vendor offers different terms, prices, and quality of their merchandise.
Our solution takes the hassle out of ordering process by automating the entire purchasing workflow.
Our purchase order system includes the following features:
a list of all supplies with aggregated vendor offers
an easy-to-use order generation tool that sends out finished orders by email in various formats,
order administration section (copying, templating, etc.),
and a report section.

Orders are made on the branch office level, where users can choose who is to be billed for the order and where it is to be delivered. It generates unique purchase order numbers, and allow users to keep track of the orders they are responsible for. Supply and price lists, vendor SKUs and other important information, can be imported in XLS/CSV format, so no manual intervention is needed during the import process.

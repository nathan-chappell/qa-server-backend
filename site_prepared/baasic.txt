A platform for rapid web and mobile app development using pre-existing front-end modules and scalable back-end infrastructure.
Baasic is a full-stack platform-as-a-service, covering both front and back-end aspects of web and mobile application development.
It can be used with client-side javascript frameworks and all major server-side languages and technologies. You can even bring new life to your static HTML sites. However, we are well aware that one size never really fits all – that's why Baasic allows you to mix and match the right tools for each individual scenario.
You don't have to start from scratch. Choose from a wide range of web or mobile application startup kits, ranging from simple sites to complex applications, all free and open-sourced.
Use and customize built-in modules. If that isn't enough, you can create your own front-end components based on customized data models and make them first-class citizens in your applications.
Use the tools you know and love. Baasic comes with an SDK for the language or framework you already use, so you never need to leave your comfort zone.
Create as many applications as you want, scale them as needed. Set yourself free from server-side infrastructure setup and maintenance headaches. Small or large, we have you covered.

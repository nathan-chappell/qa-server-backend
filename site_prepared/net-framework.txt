Mono provides full-cycle .NET custom development services resulting in robust and scalable .NET web, desktop and mobile solutions that can run on virtually any environment.
Weve been working with .NET from the early beta release of version 1.0 in late 2001.
From early Win Forms and Web Forms applications, through more complex ASP.NET MVC layered architectures, to full blown, cloud-based solutions based on microservices, our team has always adopted the best engineering practices and built reliable and scalable software.
We have started our .NET journey by building custom solutions and Web controls - scheduler, data grid, formatted textboxes, calendars, file managers,  These products were successfully shipped through the early 2000s to thousands of end users.
At the same time, weve built several versions of MonoX, a free and massively popular content management and social networking platform based on Web Forms and Web parts frameworks. It still powers hundreds of web sites and applications all over the world.
More recently, we created Baasic, a completely modular, pluggable, scalable, secure and technology-agnostic framework and service for rapid development of web and mobile apps.
Our team of experienced Microsoft-certified professionals can transform your ideas and requirements into flexible and highly scalable .NET web and mobile solutions that can run on virtually any environment.
From mobile applications running on iOS, Android and Windows, to enterprise server applications running on Windows Server and Linux, or high-scale microservices running in the cloud, we are there for you.

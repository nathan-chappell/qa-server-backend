We developed cloud-based real estate systems to satisfy specific business scenarios in the real estate industry, catering to the needs of real estate agents and their customers.
Our goal was to develop an intuitive and user-friendly software solution for listing and presentation of different property types. Besides the responsive design and fully customizable back-end engine, we were focused on the integration of the real estate listings with various mapping and geolocation services.
We have also developed a service for retrieving and automatic processing of listings and the accompanying resources (photos, documents) using third-party APIs used by different Multiple Listing Services (MLS).
Our solution enables users to keep a complete overview of all client activities and build a detailed understanding of their preferences.
A wealth of information sharing features promotes collaboration for the entire sales team.
A customized reporting engine with intuitive dashboards allows users to visualize all relevant business data and use it for better decision making.
Custom workflows cover all processes and tasks inside real-estate companies, from client interactions to back-office procedures.
Tools and technologies: ASP.NET MVC, Baasic, Angular, SQLServer, React, Power BI, TensorFlow, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, Amazon AWS

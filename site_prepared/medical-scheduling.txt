Anesthesia Scheduler is a web-based scheduling Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that coordinates call and operating room coverage across multiple hospitals.
What sets it apart from its competitors is the ability to customize the environment to meet each medical groups specific needs.
The system provides history tracking for each event. Documents can be attached to the schedule each day and can be viewed by providers, and e-mail notifications can be sent to a provider with any scheduling change. The messaging system allows messages to be sent to the entire group, subgroups or specific individuals.
Providers are able to log onto a specific screen to make requests for vacation. The provider is able to see how many vacations slots are open and how many days of vacation they have available.
System tracks used, accrued and available vacation days by the provider. Vacation approval or denial notification is available in real-time and sent to the requesting provider via email.
An advanced reporting system has numerous reports that track all aspects of a schedule. Reports can be customized to suit any group's needs. All critical provider and scheduling information is available at one paperless file.
The auto-scheduling feature is designed to evenly distribute call assignments for full and part-time employees. It is based on a complex set of rules that can be changed by system administrators to fine-tune its behavior and performance.
We also designed and developed a native mobile scheduling application for iOS and Android platforms. It features clean, performant and reliable user interface and covers complex notification scenarios, so your staff is always kept up-to-date with their assignments and schedule changes.

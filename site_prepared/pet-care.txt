While building a cloud-based system for providing pet care to customers, we integrated a variety of services ranging from cosmetic procedures and training courses to vet visits.
Supporting America's Veterinary Discount Plan.
The system we are building for our client covers most of the USA, with tens of thousands veterinarians and close to a million daily users. Participating veterinary practices give significant discounts on all medical care provided in their offices.
This solution had to include an advanced, custom-built billing system covering complex discount plans.
Due to a high volume of usage, and to solve deployment problems and improve production operations, microservices architecture was used. It is emerging as an important approach for distributed mission-critical applications.
The system is being improved and changed on a daily basis, so testing and continuous integration practices and tools are invaluable to keep everything up and running at all times.
Pet care system supports various pet management tools and user profile options; dynamic product plans and veterinary services; an advanced search of contracted and non-contracted veterinarians and their services; and an advanced reporting system.
